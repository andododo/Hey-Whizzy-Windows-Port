# ENV creation

## In the parent folder:
Make a .env file.

It should have the following:
```python
API_KEY=
IP_ADDRESS=
```

Refer to the README.md file on how to get the API key and your IP address.

Your .env file should look something like this:
```python
API_KEY=asdfqwerzxcv
IP_ADDRESS=192.168.x.x
```
